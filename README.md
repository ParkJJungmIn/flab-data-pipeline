## 프로젝트 설명

This project involves building a comprehensive data pipeline to reliably collect event logs generated by a virtual music streaming platform, preprocess and store the data, and provide the capability to visualize the stored data through a dashboard.

### Data

[Eventsim](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) is a program designed to generate event data that simulates page requests for a fictional music website. The resulting data closely resembles real user interactions but is entirely synthetic. The Docker image for Eventsim is sourced from [viirya's fork](https://github.com/viirya/eventsim), which was originally used in the Streamify project [Streamify](https://github.com/ankurchavda/streamify).

Eventsim leverages song data from the [Million Songs Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com) to generate these events. I used a subset of 10,000 songs from the Million Songs Dataset as the basis for simulating user interactions.
